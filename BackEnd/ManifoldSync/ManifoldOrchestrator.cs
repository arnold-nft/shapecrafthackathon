         * IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITY:
         * 
         * Currently, Manifold.xyz's Connect Widget allows users to authenticate with their wallets 
         * and access NFT data programmatically through a client-side data client. 
         * Embedding this widget in a frontend could enable your AI chatbot to fetch real-time,
         * user-specific NFT information dynamically.
         * 
         * However, this approach relies on each user connecting their wallet, meaning the AI 
         * would only have access to the authenticated user's data. This limits bulk or global 
         * dataset building unless many users upload their data actively.
         * 
         * Despite this limitation, enabling user-driven data queries can be valuable for 
         * generative experiences, such as asking the AI questions about specific wallet 
         * addresses, NFTs owned, or collectors associated with a contract.
         * 
         * NOTE: For this hackathon, integrating the Connect Widget is likely out of scope, 
         * but it represents a significant potential improvement that could be added later 
         * to enhance real-time and personalized data retrieval.
